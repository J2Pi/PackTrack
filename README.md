# PackTrack
Attempt at a package tracker application

Ultimate goal: An application with a UI that allows users to select carriers & input tracking numbers.

Progress: Created selenium versions of the app. Not ideal, but will be a stepping stone to the final goal. Played around with Tkinter to see how I like it. Not very satisfied so far... Looking to move it over to a web app, using Ember.js perhaps?

Update: Decided to create this as a web application using EmberJS and Rails (for creating user accounts in the future). tracker.py contains the original selenium version; trackerv2.py contains a very rough and unfinished tkinter version.
