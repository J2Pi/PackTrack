# PackTrack
Attempt at a package tracker application

Ultimate goal: An application with a UI that allows users to select carriers & input tracking numbers. The app will then display the tracked results.

Current Progress: Created selenium versions of the app. Not ideal, but will be a stepping stone to the final goal. Played around with Tkinter to see how I like it. Not very satisfied so far... Looking to move it over to a web app, using Ember.js perhaps?
